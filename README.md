# Particle Swarm Optimization

![linear-regression-gradient-descent](/pso.png)

Particle swarm optimization in computation intelligence, is a computational method to optimize an objective function. The way it works is by iteratively improving a candidate solution from a population of particles (swarm), by moving these particles around. Each of these particles are aware of their best yet position in the search space, as well as the swarm's best position yet is also known. Based on these assumptions, the swarm is expected to move towards the best solutions (positions).
